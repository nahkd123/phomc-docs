### Content format
The PhoMC documentation is built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) - an amazing documentation site made by Meta Inc.<br>
The content can be written easily without coding at all, with the support of Markdown.<br>
To have a quick overview of Markdown, read this cheatsheet: https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/.<br>
In addition, Docusaurus also supports extra features, which can be viewed here: https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features.<br>

### Organization
The documentation is divided into categories. 
- A category groups relevant pages together. 
- We also have `_category_.json` file for each category (to describe the name, the position in the sidebar, etc)
- Categories can be nested.
